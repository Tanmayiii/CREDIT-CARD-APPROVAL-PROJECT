# ðŸ“Œ Credit Card Approval Prediction
## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the approval of a credit card application based on various applicant features such as income, employment status, credit score, and other financial attributes. The model utilizes classification algorithms to determine whether an applicant is likely to be approved or rejected.

## ðŸ“Š Features and Approach
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into trends, distributions, and correlations within the dataset.
- Model Training: Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks for classification.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing models for better accuracy and generalization.
- Evaluation Metrics: Analyzing performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements
- Feature Engineering: Enhancing dataset features for better model performance.
- Ensemble Models: Combining models for improved accuracy.
- Real-Time Deployment: Implementing the model as a web-based application.
